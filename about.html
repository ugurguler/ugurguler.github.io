            <br /><br />
            Hi, I’m Uğur! My career started in the vibrant world of tourism, where I honed my communication skills and developed a deep understanding of customer needs.<br /> Over time, my creative spirit led me to graphic design, a field that instantly captured my heart.<br /> What started as a passion soon became my profession, and I earned my bachelor's degree in design.
            <br />
            As I delved deeper into the design world, I found myself drawn to user interface design and front-end development. <br />Combining aesthetics with functionality became my obsession, and I loved every step—sketching wireframes, prototyping,  and finally seeing ideas come to life on the screen.

            <br />
            I thrive on collaboration, learning new technologies, and pushing creative boundaries. <br />For me, design isn’t just a job; it’s a playground of endless possibilities where I get to turn imagination into reality.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="text-secondary">Let’s create something amazing together!</span>
            <br />
